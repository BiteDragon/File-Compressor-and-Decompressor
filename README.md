# File-Compressor-and-Decompressor
Implemented file compression and decompression functionality using lossy conversion logic in Java Swing UI

The File Compressor and Decompressor is a Java-based application with a simple user interface designed to compress and decompress files using lossy conversion logic.
With just two buttons, "Choose File to Compress" and "Choose File to Decompress," users can easily manage their storage space without compromising essential data.

This project aims to provide a seamless experience for users who want to compress files into smaller sizes, saving storage space while maintaining satisfactory data quality.
It also allows users to decompress the compressed files back to their original form, ensuring data integrity.
